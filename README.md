# The catmint language
Starter repo for a low-level/high-level hybrid programming language targetting LLVM, seeking ease-of-use and brevity of Python with C-level control over memory and STL-completeness. 

Use cases: quick low level scripting, high-level AI and ML applications, Data Science, RAD, preferably cross-compilable x86_64 and arm64, Windows and Linux.
