main.cpp
semanticAnalysis.runAnalysis()
catmint::SemanticAnalysis::visit(Program p)
    catmint::SemanticAnalysis::visit(Class each_class_in_program)

    if (typeTable.isBuiltinClass(c)) return true; // Object, String, IO
    // create a scope and add all attributes to it
    // traverse all parents
    // if an attribute, insert it in symboltable, get its type and insert that too in typetable
    // add self to symbol table

    checkFeatures(current class)

OK so the problem is when visiting a dispatch we are checkign the types of the arguments, and of course the type of an operator in a dispatch isn't in yet. It would be the type of the results of the xpression

So the bool catmint::SemanticAnalysis::checkDispatchArgs(DispatchT *d, Method *m)  doesnt check for this now... change it


Also the get type should return some sort of good natured error in this case.
